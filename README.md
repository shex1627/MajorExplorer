## Data Files

### `major_occupation_mapping.py`
Contains the mapping of 36+ college majors to relevant BLS occupations. Each major can map to multiple occupations, and occupations can appear in multiple majors (e.g., "Data scientists" appears in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, etc.).

**Majors included:**
- STEM: Computer Science, Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical, Biomedical, Environmental), Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science
- Business: Business Administration, Finance, Accounting, Marketing, Economics
- Health: Nursing, Pre-Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy
- Social Sciences: Psychology, Political Science, Sociology, History
- Humanities: Communications, English/Literature
- Other: Education, Criminal Justice, Environmental Science, Graphic Design, Performing Arts

### `data_aggregator.py`
Provides functions to:
- Parse BLS salary, job outlook, and employment data
- Aggregate statistics by major
- Generate comparison tables
- Retrieve detailed career information

## Data Source

All occupation data comes from the **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook Handbook**.

The BLS data includes:
- Occupation names
- Median annual salary
- Number of jobs
- Job outlook (growth percentage)
- Entry-level education requirements
- Job descriptions

## Customization

### Adding More Majors

Edit `major_occupation_mapping.py` and add entries to the `MAJOR_TO_OCCUPATIONS` dictionary:

```python
MAJOR_TO_OCCUPATIONS = {
    "Your New Major": [
        "BLS Occupation Name 1",
        "BLS Occupation Name 2",
        # ...
    ],
}
```

### Changing Default Majors

Modify the `DEFAULT_TOP_MAJORS` list in `major_occupation_mapping.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_TOP_MAJORS = [
    "Computer Science",
    "Nursing",
    # ... add your preferred defaults
]
```

### Updating BLS Data Path

In `app.py`, update the `BLS_DATA_PATH` constant:

```python
BLS_DATA_PATH = '/path/to/your/bls_occupations_all.csv'
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Quiz/questionnaire to suggest majors based on interests
- Geographic salary variations
- Education ROI calculations (salary vs. tuition costs)
- Career path visualizations (graphs/charts)
- Export comparison data to PDF/Excel
- Integration with additional data sources (e.g., O*NET)
